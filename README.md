# Quadruped_Project
My attempt at building the NovaSM3 by Chris Locke. This is a recreation of Spot from Boston Dynamics. This repository contains step files that I created on my own along with progress pictures towards the build and code for arduino. This project is not yet complete. 

To view uploaded step files: Save link and enter into ShareCad. These files are viewable on any platform that supports step files. I used Autodesk Fusion to model them. 

See https://novaspotmicro.com/ for credit to the NovaSM3. 

UPDATES BELOW (in ascending chronological order): 
- All 3D parts have been printed and parts sourced. 
  Slots for M3 nuts were the incorrect size and needed to be widened to fit the hardware. (reminder for updating the step files)
  The frame and legs have been assembled with servos installed. 
  35kg servos were placed in the tibia because it will need more torque to lift the body and be able to stand.

- Added first step file to test. Dimensions were slightly off so I will need to rework it.
