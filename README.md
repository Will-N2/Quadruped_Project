# Quadruped_STL_and_Code
My attempt at building the NovaSM3 by Chris Locke. This is a recreation of Spot from Boston Dynamics. This repository contains stl files that I created on my own along with progress pictures towards the build and code for arduino. This project is not yet complete. 

See https://novaspotmicro.com/ for credit to the NovaSM3. 

UPDATES BELOW (in ascending chronological order): 
- All 3D parts have been printed and parts sourced. 
  Slots for M3 nuts were the incorrect size and needed to be widened to fit the hardware. (reminder for updating the step files)
  The frame and legs have been assembled with servos installed. 
  35kg servos were placed in the tibia because it will need more torque to lift the body and be able to stand.
